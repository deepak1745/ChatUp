 # ChatUp
 This is a chat application where you can chat with other persons offline by running it on local server or online using our public link.
 This will prove to be useful in case your chats in a private organization say a company is getting recorded for security reasons or
 facebook is blocked or you are reluctant in sharing your sensitive credit card details with your flatmate sitting in next room and you
 are lazy enough to just go and tell him. So if you don't have a broadband connection at home or your mobile data pack is limited then
 just run it locally and unleash the joy of unlimited hours of chatting. Also there is no need of downloading any app which takes some
 storage space in your phone memory, just open our online public link in any browser and start chatting.
